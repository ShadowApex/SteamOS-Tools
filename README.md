## Branches
There are three main branches at the moment

`alchemist`  
Default branch - "stable" work that gets PRs, fixes, priority over all other branches.  
`brewmaster`  
Now that Jessie is stable, evaluation of the Brewmaster SteamOS release and packages is underway. **Not** recommended for use.  
`brewmaster-beta`  
Based on the brewmaster-beta repo for SteamOS "V2". **Not** recommended for use.  This is where the most active changes will occur until Brewmaster becomes more stable.  
`testing-$BRANCH`  
Branch where new scripts are made, larger alterations to existing ones implemented, and more.  

## Pull requests / suggestions
Please submit any issues / suggestions to the issues tracker on the right hand side of this page
or any corrections (with justification) as a Pull Request. Have a cool script or method to enhance SteamOS? Send it over! Your name will be added to the script header and the contributing.md file. 

## Troubleshooting
Most scripts in the main folder of the repository write stdout and stderr to `log.txt` in the current directory after completion. Please check this file before submitting any issues or pull requests.
